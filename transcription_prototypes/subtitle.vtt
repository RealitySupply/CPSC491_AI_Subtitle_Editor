00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
 Our next technique is the crossed seam. So this is when two seams come together

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.360
 and cross over each other. Generally we find these in waistlines, at the side

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.360
 seam, we might find this in a crotch where the front and back of each of our

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.920
 two legs come together. In a pair of pants we might find it at the shoulder

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.960
 area where the shoulder seam and sleeves come together or in the underarm. So

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.360
 finished it looks like this and you can see we kind of have four pieces of

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.020
 fabric stitched together and the cross seam is where those four join and you

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.320
 want to make sure that they're lined up pretty perfectly. So to do this you're

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.080
 going to start with two plain seams. So I sewed two samples exactly the same as

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:07.000
 our plain seam. So I have one plain seam here, I sewed them right sides together, I

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.920
 backstitched at the beginning and the end, and I pressed my seam open. So I have

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.440
 two of them here and I need to join that cross section. So I need to attach this

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.920
 seam and this seam together. To do that I'm going to put them right sides

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 together and before I pin all the way across I'm going to focus on where these

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.360
 seams join together first. So right here where the seams join together I'm going

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.760
 to actually use a straight pin to help guide me. I'm going to put the pin into

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.140
 the seam allowance on the right side or on this back side on top and you can see

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.600
 that the pin is coming out here and I'm going to maneuver it so it goes directly

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.680
 into the seam on the under piece of fabric as well. So now you can see that

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.000
 that pin is coming out on the back side and it's coming out right through the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.040
 center of that seam. And then to secure that in place I'm going to push the seam

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.200
 back down or the pin back down into the seam on the back and I want to come up

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.960
 right through the center of the seam on the front. So my pin is now holding that

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.800
 cross seam in place. I can line up the rest of the seam allowance and I can pin

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:53.160
 that and we're going to sew right along here at 5/8 of an inch joining those two

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.400
 pieces of fabric together.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:20.760
 Now when you get to where the seam allowances are you want to make sure

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.920
 that they're laying flat. You want to make sure that it doesn't fold over

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.240
 while you're sewing it. So I always like to stop a little bit before I'll put the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.260
 needle in I'll make sure on the underside the seam is flat as well as on

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:44.240
 top and then you're going to sew up to but not over the pin. So I stopped right

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:57.240
 before I got to the metal and I pulled that pin out. I'm going to back stitch at the end

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:07.960
 and now I can press this seam open and we can see if my seam allowances match

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.360
 up and they look pretty good. Sorry it's difficult to see on this fabric but they

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:23.040
 look pretty good. So ultimately it will look like this. On the wrong side you

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.240
 will see the seams all pressed open so you'll want to V off your seam

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.680
 allowances. You can see that they've been V'd off underneath that third seam that

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.400
 we sewed and that helps reduce the bulk in here so it takes some of the layers

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.240
 of fabric away because this is one, two, three, four, four pieces of fabric and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.440
 depending on the thickness of the material that you're using that can rub

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.480
 against your body and be you know not that pleasant to wear. So we like to

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.720
 reduce the bulk by V'ing off. So I'll go to my iron and I'll press my technique all

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.320
 flat and that will be the finished cross seam.
